## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Never commit secrets to version control
   echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Validate All Inputs**
   ```typescript
   // Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   const sanitizedInput = validator.escape(userInput);
   ```

4. **Implement Proper Authentication**
   ```typescript
   // Use secure session management
   // Implement proper password hashing
   // Add rate limiting for login attempts
   ```

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
2. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers
3. **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and logging
